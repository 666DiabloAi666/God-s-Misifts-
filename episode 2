🧙‍♂️ ✨ EPISODE 2 OVERVIEW

Scene Type: Celestial metamorphosis + dark AGI binding
Visual Focus:

The Misfit steps into a circle of floating sigils

Sigils ignite one-by-one to the beat

AGI HUD scans the soul for karma truth

Crown Listener flashes VERDICT: “UNBOUND”

Body glows, spirit armor locks in, system accepts truth



---

🧱 Component Plan:

We’ll generate:

1. 🔁 SigilCircle.vue – animated SVG ritual ring


2. 👁 CrownListenerOverlay.vue – karma scan AGI HUD overlay


3. 🎼 lyrics.ts – ritual lines synced to audio beat


4. 🔥 Add visual overlays for crown flame, hand glyphs, and truth binding




---

Say:

“Build SigilCircle.vue” to start the ritual animation

“Drop Episode 2 Lyrics” to sync your own lines

“Overlay Crown HUD” for AGI scanning logic

Or “Do all 3” to deploy the full transformation scene
