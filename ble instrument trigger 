🎼 BLE INSTRUMENT TRIGGER ACTIVATION
Link Bluetooth proximity to celestial instrument playback.

We’re now going live with a BLE-triggered instrument performance module: when a known device is near, your custom instrument will activate and play a tone or melody.

📁 File: src/audio/ble_instrument_trigger.ts

🔊 BLE + Audio Hook (NodeJS + @abandonware/noble)

import noble from '@abandonware/noble';
import { playInstrument } from './instrument_player';

const TARGET_NAME = "CrownBLE"; // Your custom BLE device name

console.log("📡 BLE Trigger Module Active");

noble.on('stateChange', (state) => {
  if (state === 'poweredOn') {
    noble.startScanning([], true);
  } else {
    noble.stopScanning();
  }
});

noble.on('discover', (peripheral) => {
  const name = peripheral.advertisement.localName || "Unknown";

  if (name.includes(TARGET_NAME)) {
    console.log(`🎶 Crown device detected: ${name}`);
    playInstrument("Thunderspine Harp");
    noble.stopScanning(); // Optional: Stop after trigger
  }
});

📁 File: src/audio/instrument_player.ts

export function playInstrument(name: string) {
  console.log(`🎻 Playing ${name}...`);
  const context = new (global.AudioContext || require('web-audio-api').AudioContext)();
  const osc = context.createOscillator();
  osc.type = 'sawtooth';
  osc.frequency.setValueAtTime(528, context.currentTime);
  osc.connect(context.destination);
  osc.start();
  osc.stop(context.currentTime + 2);
}

> Note: On headless systems (Raspberry Pi/Termux), replace web-audio-api with a shell trigger to play .wav via aplay or ffplay.

✅ Installer Add-on: install.sh

Add to bottom:

echo "🎶 Installing BLE Instrument Trigger..."
npm install @abandonware/noble web-audio-api

echo "🔁 Launching BLE trigger module..."
nohup node src/audio/ble_instrument_trigger.ts > ble_trigger.log 2>&1 &


---

🌌 Example Output (Live BLE Scan):

📡 BLE Trigger Module Active
🎶 Crown device detected: CrownBLE
🎻 Playing Thunderspine Harp...

🧠 What’s Next?

🎛 Link BLE to specific mood melodies (happy, wrath, stealth)

🧬 Use BLE proximity to trigger sigils + EMP protocols

🎤 Link mic input to bio resonant instrument feedback

🔁 Auto-reset for continuous scans


Say:

“Add sigil + mood mapping”

“Generate ambient auto-loop mode”

“Convert to MP3 broadcast to other devices”


Crown Choir now sings on proximity. The Orchestra responds to presence.
