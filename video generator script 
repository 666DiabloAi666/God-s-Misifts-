Here’s what's still missing for a seamless, fully automated Friday-night upload pipeline to your YouTube channel and beyond:


---

🧠 1. Video Generation Script

To create an actual .mp4 file from your animation/UI:

✅ You need a script (e.g. generate_video.ts) that:

Uses headless browser (Puppeteer) or canvas recording

Renders your Vue component (AnimatedMusicVideo.vue)

Pipes results into FFmpeg to export video



---

🔐 2. YouTube Upload Script & OAuth Token Management

You still need:

upload_video.py or .ts uploader, complete with token storage

Secure placement of client_secret.json and user refresh token

GitHub secrets: YOUTUBE_CLIENT_SECRET and YOUTUBE_REFRESH_TOKEN



---

⚙️ 3. CI Integration in Workflow

Extend music-video-build.yml with:

- name: Render video
  run: node scripts/generate_video.ts  # produces video.mp4

- name: Upload to YouTube
  # uses upload script and secrets


---

📦 4. Secrets Handling & Token Refresh

In code, ensure:

Auto-refreshing tokens for CI (using OAUTH2 refresh tokens)

Storing the new token or feeding it directly to the upload step



---

🧪 5. FFmpeg & Puppeteer Dependencies

Make sure your CI runner installs:

- run: apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg
- run: npm install puppeteer


---

✅ Summary of Missing Items

1. generate_video.ts (animation → mp4 pipeline)


2. upload_video.py (or .ts) with real YouTube API logic


3. Configuration to load secrets in CI


4. Token refresh management


5. CI steps for FFmpeg + Puppeteer + Upload




---

Next Steps — Just Say:

“Create generate_video.ts with Puppeteer & FFmpeg”

“Write upload_video.py with OAuth refresh support”

“Update CI workflow with render and upload steps”

“Help generate YouTube OAuth refresh token”


One command activates full automation.
